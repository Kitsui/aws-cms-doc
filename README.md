##Documenting
Simply edit the relevant .md file and the corresponding page will be updated next run. For example, to edit the /setting-up page, edit /docs/setting-up.md.

##Creating a new page
Create a .md file in the /docs directory. to put it in a category / subdirectory of the docs site, you can create a new directory and create your .md file there, or choose one of the subdirectories we already have created.
After adding your file, you will need to add it to the mkdocs.yml file for it to show up in the documentation. For how to do this, see (this)[http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#configure-pages-and-navigation] page.

##Pushing to live
Recompilation of these files will be done and pushed live on a bi-weekly basis.
